        <h1>FCFS Disk Scheduling Algorithms</h1>
        <h5 class="w3-padding-8">
          <b>
            FCFS stands for First Come First Serve.
          </b>
          
          It is the simplest Disk Scheduling algorithm. As the name suggests, this algorithm entertains requests in the order they arrive in the disk queue. 
          <p>
          <b>
            Advantages-
          </b>
          
          
          It is simple and easy to understand.  The algorithm looks very fair and there is no starvation (all requests are serviced sequentially) but generally, it does not provide the fastest service.
          </p>
          
          <b>
            Disadvantages-
          </b>
          The scheme does not optimize the seek time.
          The request may come from different processes therefore there is the possibility of inappropriate movement of the head.

        <h1>SSTF Disk Scheduling Algorithm</h1>
        <h5 class="w3-padding-8">
          <b>
            SSTF stands for Shortest Seek Time First.
          </b>
          
          This algorithm services that request next which requires least number of head movements from its current position regardless of the direction.
          It breaks the tie in the direction of head movement.
          <p>
          <b>
            Advantages-
          </b>
          
          
          It reduces the total seek time as compared to FCFS.
          
          It provides increased throughput.
          
          It provides less average response time and waiting time.
          </p>
          
          <b>
            Disadvantages-
          </b>
          There is an overhead of finding out the closest request.
          The requests which are far from the head might starve for the CPU.
          It provides high variance in response time and waiting time.
          Switching the direction of head frequently slows down the algorithm.

        <b>
          SCAN Disk Scheduling Algorithm-
        </b>
        As the name suggests, this algorithm scans all the cylinders of the disk back and forth.
        Head starts from one end of the disk and move towards the other end servicing all the requests in between.
        After reaching the other end, head reverses its direction and move towards the starting end servicing all the requests in between.
        The same process repeats.

        <p>
          <b>
            NOTES-
          </b>
        SCAN Algorithm is also called as Elevator Algorithm.
        This is because its working resembles the working of an elevator.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          <b>
            Advantages-
          </b>
        It is simple, easy to understand and implement.
        It does not lead to starvation.
        It provides low variance in response time and waiting time.
        </p>

        <p>
          <b>
            Disadvantages-
          </b>
        It causes long waiting time for the cylinders just visited by the head.
        It causes the head to move till the end of the disk even if there are no requests to be serviced.

          C - SCAN Disk Scheduling Algorithm-

        Circular-SCAN Algorithm is an improved version of the SCAN Algorithm.
        Head starts from one end of the disk and move towards the other end servicing all the requests in between.
        After reaching the other end, head reverses its direction.
        It then returns to the starting end without servicing any request in between.

          <b>
            Advantages-
          </b>
        The waiting time for the cylinders just visited by the head is reduced as compared to the SCAN Algorithm.
        It provides uniform waiting time.
        It provides better response time.

        <b>
        LOOK Disk Scheduling Algorithm-
        </b>
      LOOK Algorithm is an improved version of the SCAN Algorithm.
      Head starts from the first request at one end of the disk and moves towards the last request at the other end servicing all the requests in between.
      After reaching the last request at the other end, head reverses its direction.
      It then returns to the first request at the starting end servicing all the requests in between.
      The same process repeats.
        <p>
          <b>
            NOTE-
          </b>
        The main difference between SCAN Algorithm and LOOK Algorithm is-

        SCAN Algorithm scans all the cylinders of the disk starting from one end to the other end even if there are no requests at the ends.
        LOOK Algorithm scans all the cylinders of the disk starting from the first request at one end to the last request at the other end.

        <p>
          <b>
            Advantages-
          </b> 
        It does not causes the head to move till the ends of the disk when there are no requests to be serviced.
        It provides better performance as compared to SCAN Algorithm.
        It does not lead to starvation.
        It provides low variance in response time and waiting time.
