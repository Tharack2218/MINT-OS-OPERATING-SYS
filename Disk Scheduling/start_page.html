        <h5 class="w3-padding-8">
          <ul>
        <li>
        IBM introduced the first magnetic disk, the RAMAC, in 1955; it held 5 megabytes and rented for $3,200 per month. Magnetic disks are platters coated with iron oxide, like tape and drums. 
        </li>
        <li>
        An arm with a tiny wire coil, the read/write (R/W) head, moves radially over the disk, which is divided into concentric tracks composed of small arcs, or sectors, of data.
        </li>
        <li>
          Magnetized regions of the disk generate small currents in the coil as it passes, thereby allowing it to “read” a sector; similarly, a small current in the coil will induce a local magnetic change in the disk, thereby “writing” to a sector.
        </li>
        <li>
        The disk rotates rapidly (up to 15,000 rotations per minute), and so the R/W head can rapidly reach any sector on the disk.
        </li>

      </ul>
      </h5>

        <p>Magnetic storage or magnetic recording is the storage of data on a magnetized medium. Magnetic storage uses different patterns of magnetisation in a magnetizable material to store data and is a form of non-volatile memory. The information is accessed using one or more read/write heads.</p>

      <b>
      Need of disk scheduling
      </b>
      </h1>
        <h5 class="w3-padding-8">
      <ul>
      <li>
      One of the responsibilities of the operating system is to use the hardware
          efficiently. For the disk drives, meeting this responsibility entails having fast access time and large disk bandwidth.   
          </li>
      <li>
      For magnetic disks, the access time has
          two major components.The seek time is the
          time for the disk arm to move the heads to the cylinder containing the desired
          sector.
      </li>
      <li>
      The rotational latency is the additional time for the disk to rotate the
          desired sector to the disk head. The disk bandwidth is the total number of bytes
          transferred, divided by the total time between the first request for service and
          the completion of the last transfer.
      </li>
      <li>
      We can improve both the access time and
          the bandwidth by managing the order in which disk I/O requests are serviced.
      </li>
      </ul>
      </h5>
        <p>Whenever a process needs I/O to or from the disk, it issues a system call to
          the operating system. The request specifies several pieces of information:
          <ul>
            <li>
              Whether this operation is input or output
            </li>
            <li>
              What the disk address for the transfer is
            </li>
            <li>
              What the memory address for the transfer is
            </li>
            <li>
              What the number of sectors to be transferred is
            </li>
          </ul>
        
          If the desired disk drive and controller are available, the request can be
          serviced immediately. If the drive or controller is busy, any new requests
          for service will be placed in the queue of pending requests for that drive.
          For a multiprogramming system with many processes, the disk queue may
          often have several pending requests. Thus, when one request is completed, the
          operating system chooses which pending request to service next. How does
          the operating system make this choice? Any one of several disk-scheduling
          algorithms can be used, and we discuss them next.</p>
